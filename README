The genesis of this system origninated from features previously provided by:
 mon-systems/image-rotate.lisp
 clime/clime-hash-directory-tree.lisp

IMAGE-OPS is dependent on the system MON:

:SEE https://github.com/mon-key/mon-systems-cl
 git://github.com/mon-key/mon-systems-cl.git

We intend that Additional features from the system CL-BMP will be incorporated
with IMAGE-OPS as needed at which time it will become a dependencey as well.

:SEE https://github.com/mon-key/cl-bmp

Likewise, we anticipate incorporating features form Walter Pelissero's systems:

:SEE http://wcp.sdf-eu.org/software/

In particular we anticipate incorporating features of the following:

 TIFF4CL -- http://wcp.sdf-eu.org/software/tiff4cl-20090828.src.tbz
 metafs  -- http://wcp.sdf-eu.org/software/metafs-20110308.src.tbz
 sclf    -- http://wcp.sdf-eu.org/software/sclf-20110816.src.tbz

However, at present TIFF4CL is not distributed with Quicklisp, and it is not
clear whether we should use the metafs and sclf systems provided with Quicklisp
or a locally maintained (and likely divergent) repo.

Some features provided by the image-ops system are SBCL dependent.

While some initial attempts are made towards maintaining portability it is
likely adjustments will be needed to get IMAGE-OPS running on other
implementations.

I've tried to use equivalent Osicat feature where there is an apparent 1:1
compatibility with a feature provided from the SB-EXT and SB-POSIX packages.

IMAGE-OPS relies on SB-EXT:RUN-PROGRAM likely ASDF:RUN-SHELL-COMMAND could be
substituted.

IMAGE-OPS relies on SB-THREAD:MAKE-THREAD likely a thread compatibility package
could be substituted.

IMAGE-OPS relies on SB-EXT:WITH-LOCKED-HASH-TABLE and binds some variables to
hash-tables with (make-hash-table {...} :synchronized t) likely other
implementations provide equivalent routines which might easily be substituted.
